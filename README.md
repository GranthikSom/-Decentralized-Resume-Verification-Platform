# Decentralized Resume Verification Platform  


## Project Description  
A blockchain-based platform for verifying resumes and work history on-chain, eliminating fraud and ensuring authenticity.

## Project Vision  
To create a transparent, trustless system where employers and job seekers can interact with verified work credentials.

## Future Scope  
- **Employer Endorsements:** Allow employers to verify and endorse resumes.  
- **NFT Resumes:** Convert verified resumes into NFTs for easy sharing.  
- **Skill Certifications:** Integrate certification authorities to verify skills.  
- **Decentralized Identity:** Enable secure identity verification via blockchain.  

## Key Features  
- **Submit Resume:** Users can submit resumes on-chain.  
- **Verification:** Employers or authorized verifiers can verify work history.  
- **Immutable Records:** Resumes are stored securely and cannot be tampered with.  
- **Public and Private Access:** Resumes can be shared selectively.  

## How to Use  
1. **Deploy the contract** (if not deployed already).  
2. **Submit a resume** using the smart contract function.  
3. **Employers or verifiers** can verify resumes on-chain.  
4. **Resumes remain immutable** and can be accessed anytime.  

## Deployment Steps  
1. Use **Remix IDE**, **Hardhat**, or **Foundry** to deploy the contract.  
2. Fund the deployment wallet with test ETH (if using a testnet).  
3. Deploy and get the contract address.  
4. Update this README with the deployed address.
