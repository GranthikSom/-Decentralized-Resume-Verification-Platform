## How to Use  
1. **Deploy the contract** (if not deployed already).  
2. **Submit a resume** using the smart contract function.  
3. **Employers or verifiers** can verify resumes on-chain.  
4. **Resumes remain immutable** and can be accessed anytime.  

## Deployment Steps  
1. Use **Remix IDE**, **Hardhat**, or **Foundry** to deploy the contract.  
2. Fund the deployment wallet with test ETH (if using a testnet).  
3. Deploy and get the contract address.  
4. Update this README with the deployed address.
